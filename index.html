            <p style="text-align:center;"> As someone who is interested in global history and culture, traveling is a major part of my life. Traveling internationally allows me to experience foreign traditions firsthand. My passion for global relations is the reason why I am a member of my high school’s Model United Nations Club and vice president of the Amnesty International club. I am also part of my high school’s Global Pathways Program, where students learn to be more globally aware and participate in traveling and global service. I have traveled to China, many European countries, and many North American areas. Here’s a brief summary on some of my favorite places on this great planet: </p>

                        <h2>France </h2>
                        <p> In the summer of 2017, my family and I traveled to Paris, France. We visited many well-known sites like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, Champs-Élysées, Sacré-Cœur, the Palace of Versailles, and Les Invalides. Each of these famous landmarks were filled with culture and rich history. Even just walking on the streets of the city was an immersive cultural experience. One could smell the fresh traditional food of the country, admire the beautiful architecture, and listen to people talk in the Romance language of French.

                    <h2>Italy</h2>
                    <p>As someone who loves European history, I had to visit Italy. The major cities I visited in Italy were Venice, Milan, and of course, Rome! To get an amazing tour of Venice and its architecture, I highly recommend going on a Gondola ride. In Milan, my family strolled around the shopping plaza Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and visited the historic cathedral, Duomo di Milano. When visiting Italy, one has to explore every inch of Rome. Every street and plaza in the city has extraordinary local meals, a piece of the country’s long history, and the sound of traditional music. It’s like a history textbook coming alive right in front of your eyes. When visiting the remains of important historical landmarks, I could really feel what life was like in the past in Rome.</p>

                    <h2>China</h2>
                    <p>Even though I was born in Canada and raised in the United State, my parents are both Chinese so I had to visit the country where they grew up. Most of my family lives in China, so getting to hang out with them for 3 weeks in China was a dream come true. Not only did I learn about China’s history and culture whening visiting Beijing and my parents’ hometown, but I also got to learn about my family’s background. Hearing stories from my relatives and playing Chinese games with my cousins made me feel as though I was raised in China my whole life. Trying the unique cuisine of Chinese was also a very amazing and fun experience. While visiting family, we also toured some great landmarks like the Great Wall of China, Tiananmen Square, and the Palace Museum.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align:center;">Music</h3>
                <p style="text-align:center;">Music has been a major aspect of my life. I love expressing myself, and I believe music is one of the most beautiful ways to connect with others. Ever since I was little, I was interested in songs, dancing, and instruments. I took piano lessons and practiced for 8 years. Most of my favorite songs were the ones with the most emotion. Later on in life, I used my piano skills to learn how to play the guitar and ukulele. When I was 5, I took tap and ballet classes. Even though I didn’t stick with the classes, I still love dancing and moving to a beat. The best part of music though for me personally is listening to other artists’ songs and connecting to it. I constantly have my headphones in my ears wherever I go and constantly jam out to music at home too. My favorite genres are pop and acoustics. I especially love songs that are raw and have great instrumentals. Some artists that I connect with most are One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Niall Horan, and Shawn Mendes.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align:center;">Swim</h3>
                <p style="text-align:center;">I have tried many different sports in my life like soccer, tennis, ice-skating, and dance but the one sport that I stuck with was swimming. Without the sport, I would not be the person I am today. I started swim lessons when I was 5 and joined my current swim team when I was 7. Over the years, I have learned so much and made so many close friends. There have been many ups and downs throughout my journey with swimming. Each obstacle I have come across has made me a stronger and more persistent women. Each failure has made me more determined for success. Every accomplishment has made me realize how important hard-work is. Without swimming, I wouldn’t be the hardworking, passionate individual I am today so I am extremely grateful for this amazing sport.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center;">My best events are any butterfly events, sprint freestyle events, and the 400 individual medley. I have been swimming with the Andover / North Andover Hurricanes club team ever since I was 7. I also compete with my high school team and have helped contribute to 2 Division 1 MIAA State Championship titles. Some of my best accomplishments are competing at the New England Age Groups Championships and the MIAA Division 1 State Championships.</p>
